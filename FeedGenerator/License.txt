This is a public repo for testing purposes.
I have no claim on the code but be aware that the magento 2 data provider and transformation classes asre loosely
inspired (or copied if I needed no modificatin) by https://github.com/run-as-root/Magento-2-Google-Shopping-Feed

The file input/output is based on magento default functionalities.
